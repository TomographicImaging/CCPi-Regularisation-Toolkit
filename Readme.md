Iterative image reconstruction (IIR) methods frequently require regularisation to ensure convergence and make inverse problem well-posed. The CCPi-Regularisation Toolkit (CCPi-RGL) toolkit provides a set of 2D/3D regularisation strategies to guarantee a better performance of IIR methods (higher SNR and resolution). The regularisation modules for scalar and vectorial datasets are based on the [proximal operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_operator) framework and can be used with [proximal splitting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_gradient_method), such as PDHG, Douglas-Rachford, ADMM, FISTA and [others](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3522). While the main target for CCPi-RGL is [tomographic image reconstruction](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR), the toolkit can be used for image denoising problems. The core modules are written in C-OMP and CUDA languages and wrappers for Matlab and Python are provided. With [CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/index.html) dependency installed for Python, one can use regularisers directly without the need for explicit compilation. We recommend this option as the simplest to start with if you've got a GPU. This software can also be used by running in parallel across multiple GPU devices on a PC or a cluster compute node.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.7+) and/or [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab)
- C compilers
- `nvcc` (CUDA SDK) compilers
  - [CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev) for the GPU-enabled methods

## Package modules

### Single-channel (scalar)

1. Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) Total Variation (explicit PDE minimisation scheme) **2D/3D CPU/GPU + CuPy**[^1]
2. Fast-Gradient-Projection (FGP) Total Variation **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^2]
3. Split-Bregman (SB) Total Variation **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^5]
4. Primal-Dual (PD) Total Variation **2D/3D CPU/GPU + CuPy**[^13]
5. Total Generalised Variation (TGV) model for higher-order regularisation **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^6][^13]
6. Linear and nonlinear diffusion (explicit PDE minimisation scheme) **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^8]
7. Anisotropic Fourth-Order Diffusion (explicit PDE minimisation) **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^9]
8. A joint ROF-LLT (Lysaker-Lundervold-Tai) model for higher-order regularisation **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^10][^11]
9. Nonlocal Total Variation regularisation (GS fixed point iteration) **2D CPU/GPU**[^12]

### Multi-channel (vectorial)

1. Fast-Gradient-Projection (FGP) Directional Total Variation **2D/3D CPU/GPU**[^3][^4][^2]
2. Total Nuclear Variation (TNV) penalty **2D+channels CPU**[^7]

## Installation

The package comes as a [CMake](https://cmake.org) project and additional wrappers for Python and Matlab. Please see more detailed [Installation](./Installation.md) information.

### Python binaries

To install precompiled binaries, you need `conda` and install from the `ccpi` channel using :

```sh
conda install ccpi-regulariser -c ccpi -c conda-forge
```

### Python (GPU-CuPy)

One can also use some of the GPU modules with the provided [CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/index.html) interfaces. The functions in `ccpi-regularisation-cupy` package work with CuPy arrays as an input and return a CuPy array for output.

```sh
conda install -c httomo ccpi-regularisation-cupy
```

Once installed please see [Demos](./demos/demo_gpu_regularisers3D_CuPy.py). Please note that not all modules are yet supported as this is an ongoing development. One can install both CuPy-driven and the `ccpi-regulariser` package in one environment, but please be aware that the functions carry the identical names.
