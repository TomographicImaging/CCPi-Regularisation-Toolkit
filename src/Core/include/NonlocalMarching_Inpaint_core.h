/* C-OMP implementation of Nonlocal Vertical Marching inpainting method (2D case)
 * The method is heuristic but computationally efficent (especially for larger images).
 * It developed specifically to smoothly inpaint horizontal or inclined missing data regions in sinograms
 * The method WILL not work satisfactory if you have lengthy vertical stripes of missing data
 *
 * Inputs:
 * 1. 2D image or sinogram with horizontal or inclined regions of missing data
 * 2. Mask of the same size as A in 'unsigned char' format  (ones mark the region to inpaint, zeros belong to the data)
 * 3. Linear increment to increase searching window size in iterations, values from 1-3 is a good choice

 * Output:
 * 1. Inpainted image or a sinogram
 * 2. updated mask
 *
 * Reference: TBA
